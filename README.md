For a college project, I created a SQL database for a Shop Chain "Moonlight Coffee" .This project required several stages of development: establishing the project theme, creation of the logical scheme, creation of the conceptual scheme, normalization of the Database, denormalization of the Database, presentation of the DBMS used, writing the SQL code, testing some query examples.This project was a perfect opportunity to learn how to create and manage a Database.
