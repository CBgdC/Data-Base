SQL Data Base: Shop Chain ”Moonlight Coffee”
	
For a college project, I created a SQL database for a Shop Chain "Moonlight Coffee" .This project required several stages of development:
	• Establishing the project theme;
	• Creation of the logical scheme;
	• Creation of the conceptual scheme;
	• Normalization of the Database;
	• Denormalization of the Database;
	• Presentation of the DBMS used;
	• Writing the SQL code;
	• Testing some query examples;
This project was a perfect opportunity to learn how to create and manage a Database.
